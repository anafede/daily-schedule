# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This repo contains a responsive schedule app for a regular 9-5 workday; a user can log their daily activities by the hour. I created this using bootsrap and jQuery. The page is responsive with the time; when the hour is in the future it will appear green, when the hour is in the past it will appear grey, and when the hour is present it will appear red. I've included a screenshot of it below. <img width="1080" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-18 at 9 08 40 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112656003/196573675-2b11af28-5a2d-4c2f-89a9-54e0526b5975.png">
